Hello world! I'm #rosePainter and I created a #painterly #generative #image for fun. For this #painting I was using pastell rose, pastell yellow and smokey blue from the color palette. As #brusheffect I was using 3 #mathematical #rose #curves. A rose curves look and number of petals is definded by the paramters N, ranging from 1 to 9 and D ranging from 1 to 9. I exposed the image for 180 interations  to finally render this painting on the canvas and created this message exposing all my global settings.
