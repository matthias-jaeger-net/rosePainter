My computer program #rosePainter sucessfully executed and created 12 #mathematical rose curves as seed points for a #painterly #generative #image. A rose curves number of petals is definded by the paramters N, ranging from 1 to 9 and D ranging from 1 to 9. The exposure time was 200 interations  and the palette was shaded in smokey red, pastelly rose, purple rose, pastell yellow and petrol green to finally render this #generative #image for you. It even created this text.
