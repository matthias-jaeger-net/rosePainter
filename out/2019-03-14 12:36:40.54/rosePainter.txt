My program rosePainter was initialized at 2019-03-14 12:36:40.54 and  sucessfully created a 800x800 canvas width a crop facto of 120.  What you see is an arrangement of 12 mathematical rose curves with random origins, paramters and size.  All points of these curves are RED_SMOKEY, ROSE_PASTELL, ROSE_PURPLE, BLUE_SMOKEY, GREEN_MINT, GREEN_PETROL,  and moved 200 frames.
