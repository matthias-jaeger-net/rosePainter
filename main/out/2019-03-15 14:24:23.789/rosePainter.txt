'Done with that artwork you wanted', said #rosePainter and opened the 'dist' folder on my local machine.  'I have created a #painterly #generative #artwork using smokey red, pastell rose, pastell yellow, smokey blue, mint green and petrol green from the palette', he shows me his latest canvas: 'Created at 2019-03-15 14:24:23.789' and explains that he brushed 40 #mathematical #rose #curves randomly on the #canvas. 'I was feeling like feeling-4 and gave each #rose #curve the paramters N random(1 - 9) and D random(1 - 9).', he said and continued, 'It took me 280 lifecycles to create this #image for you, my friend.'  I thanked him and said that I'll post this on my #instagram, but I won't need to do much, because rosePainter also created this message exposing all his global settings. #processing #java #oop #generativeart #generativedesign #madewith code by man and machine
