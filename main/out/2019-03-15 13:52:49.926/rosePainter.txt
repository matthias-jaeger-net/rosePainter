I'm done with the artwork, said #rosePainter just look in the 'dist' folder and you will find  a #painterly #generative #image for using smokey red, pastell rose, glowy rose, darker rose, darker purple, pastell yellow, smokey blue, darker blue, light blue, mint green and petrol green from the NamedColors palette. I #brushed 40 #mathematical #rose #curves  randomly on the canvas. I was feeling like feeling-4 and gave each rose curve the paramters N random(1 - 9) and D random(1 - 9). I exposed the image for 280 interations  to finally render this painting on the canvas and created this message exposing all my global settings.
